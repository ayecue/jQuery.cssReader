cssReader (jQuery Plugin)
================
Author: ayecue
Version: 2.6 & 2.6 less
Language: Javascript
Framework: jQuery


Short Description:
================
With this plugin you can read CSS files. It will also read the parts in the CSS file which your normal browser won't read.


Advanced Description:
================
The Internet Explorer won't read CSS properties like for example "text-shadow". This script will read it
even when you are using the Internet Explorer. Just imagine the case that you got CSS3 properties in your stylesheet.
And you want to fix them but automated and not manual. So this plugin will be very helpful.

You can also create your own properties, the script will read them. As long as they are valid. Here an example:

Code:
================
	.my_css_class
	{
	  width: 100%;
	  margin: 0;
	  my-own-propery: hey there; //Your own property.
	}
================

The "cssReader" will also recognize the priority of your property. The priority depend on position and selectors used 
at the class where the property is in.

Code:
================
	.my_css_class
	{
	  width: 100%;
	}
	div.my_css_class
	{
	  width: 50%; //This property will have a higher priority.
	}
================

There are much more posibilities but that's for now.

	@compiledInstance

First Steps:
================
Now i'll describe what's done in the "test1.html". This little test shows how the "cssReader" reads CSS, compiling everything and declaring elements.

Code:
================
	//Create a new "cssReader".
	var newReader=new cssReader();
				
	//Here we set the CSS content from the style element in the head.
	newReader.setCss($("head style").html());
	//Now Im converting the whole CSS content to an array.
	newReader.fetchCss();
	//After converting I read the whole array without a filter.
	newReader.read();
	
	//After everything is setup I can start a search. This search I do without any search string.
	//That's because I want to get everything.
	var result=newReader.search(function(c){
		//In the callback I get all compiled classes.
		for (property in c)
		{
			//The property is always the key of every object inside a compiled stack.
			//With the object property ".attrPath" I get the current element and
			//with the property ".attrValue" I get the value of the current property.
			//So this call do nothing else than giving every element their class values.
			$(c[property].attrPath).css(property,c[property].attrValue);
		}
	});
================

I'll add some more examples in the future.

"2.6" vs "2.6 less":
================
There are small differences:
- "2.6 less" need less cache
- "2.6 less" loops are abit more difficult
- "2.6" got an easier tree of variables

But I the end both do the same. Here some performance testing (Just scraped through the whole CSS File without filters):
## "2.6"
- 4% slower than "2.6 less" with ~ 17 Ops/sec (Firefox)
- 3% slower than "2.6 less" with ~ 20.6 Ops/sec (Chrome)
- 3% slower than "2.6 less" with ~ 14.7 Ops/sec (Safari)
- 1% slower than "2.6 less" with ~ 15.5 Ops/sec (Opera)
- 1% slower than "2.6 less" with ~ 16.2 Ops/sec (IE9)
- 1% slower than "2.6 less" with ~ 8.2 Ops/sec (IE8)
- 0.31% slower than "2.6 less" with ~ 0.77 Ops/sec (IE7)

## "2.6 less"
- 4% faster than "2.6" with ~ 17.5 Ops/sec (Firefox)
- 3% faster than "2.6" with ~ 21.3 Ops/sec (Chrome)
- 3% faster than "2.6" with ~ 15.5 Ops/sec (Safari)
- 1% faster than "2.6" with ~ 15.7 Ops/sec (Opera)
- 1% faster than "2.6" with ~ 16.5 Ops/sec (IE9)
- 1% faster than "2.6" with ~ 8.3 Ops/sec (IE8)
- 0.31% faster than "2.6" with ~ 0.78 Ops/sec (IE7)

The test CSS had 42082 (34195 without whitespaces) signs on 1975 lines.
